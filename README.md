Did you ever wish you had a magic button that would instantly reply to those annoying e-mails and that no one would be able to tell it is not a genuine response?

Well, let me tell you. Your dreams came true (at least that was mine).

GmailAPI coupled with award-winning chatbots from personalityForge brings you that long awaited button, which will not only save you the time, but might also cheer you up a bit.

Have fun!
